I've spent the last ~10 years working remotely.

Tools like [Github](https://github.com/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) and [Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) make it all possible.

I've spent months of my life working from Zion, Gooseberry Mesa, Fruita, Moab, and other places that are warm during our off-seasons in Jackson.

A Camper and a Tether take my office anywhere.

My sense of place is so important.  It's why I live in Jackson.
Last week I decided to park the camper about :15 min away from town, in Curtis Canyon.
I've been heading up there to work on and off for a couple weeks, getting so much done when the mosquitos are sleeping.
