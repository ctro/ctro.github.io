I'm starting the old blog engine up again.
I've long been aware of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but just _now_ started using it.

This is simplicity: [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to static HTML.
History managed with git.  No databases, no servers. Hosted for free on github.

Updating this blog is as simple as `git push`.

I'm hoping to fill these pages with ramblings from work, life, and family.

No promises though.
