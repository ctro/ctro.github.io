<h3>I found a list of "good ideas" that I used to keep</h3>
<h2>I think they want to be free</h2>

<h1>IDEAS</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Android app eMonk : disables Text(speak), Phone(hear), Browser(see).  Somehow use the
Monkey (get it?) emoji to return status to other people, or to remind yourself.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>&quot;smooch&quot; sound to take a picture with camera</p>
</li>
<li><p>Super simple home automation via cron and home server</p>
</li>
<li><p>Util for simple AWS setups where you want to open a security group to YOUR IP only.  The util just knows how to open/close this SG whenever you need to SSH into your server.</p>
</li>
<li><p>NewsAlarm:  wake up to some podcast or audio feed like Jim Woodmency&#39;s mountainweather.com.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What tech could redistribute wealth?  Can anything do this automatically?  What about making it super easy to tap a button on your phone to give small donations to some charity...?  </p>
</li>
<li><p>A JS game that uses emoji as characters etc. Skiing?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Powder Day Service: watches snowfall and alerts services if it&#39;s a powder day.  IFTT? Slack? Vacation Responder?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make GPG Easy.  An app to pass secret notes or something.</p>

</li>
<li><p>work on behalf of govt, cross referencing missing and wanted public lists w internal company lists.  Implement this API for govt.  Think: consuming the API at twitter to search for wanted and missing people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>site to watch windmills generate energy.  With gauges for current output, and a way to tell the lay-man how much power that really is.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go project:  Timebomb unix utility.  composable.  Just rm&#39;s a file after a certain time period. Think: removing someone&#39;s public key from a server after 3 days.  Recurring timebomb for blowing away browser caches.  who knows what else.</p>
</li>
<li><p>web utilities for the everyman. chainable pipeable.  Like simple composeable unix utilities but via API.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Guitar Mirror:  A way to easily show the mirror of a YouTube video.  Collect together how-to videos for playing songs on instruments and flip them around for easy learning.  I learn best by watching other peoples hands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>a way to know who to vote for. I want to trust Jim Stanford.  I want to pull up my phone and see the people he&#39;s going to vote for.  I&#39;ll do the same.</p>
</li>
<li><p>some manifestation of the golden rule.  or &quot;if you cant say something nice&quot; a-la &quot;How to win friends...&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure if this could be a utility, or has to be a game?  i really just like these 2 premesis and would love to devote myself to them.</p>
